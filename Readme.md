## About Me

**Hey, I'm Vyom Pundhir**

- I'm 22 and I live in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. I'm currently learning **Full Stack Web Development**.

## Project Description

- In this project, I have built a **Crypto Market HomePage** from the scratch using core `HTML` & `CSS`

- This project heavily relies on `flex-box` and various `flex properties` like `align-items, justify-content, gap `and `flex-direction`. Along with this the also comprises of `positioning of elements and how an image can be set as a Background of the page` in `CSS` This project also comprises of `margin, padding, height, width, background, font-family, font-weight, font-size` properties of `CSS`.

- Note that I haven't made it **Responsive** to **Different Screen Sizes**, so it will work only on the laptop screen. If you are using Desktop, please zoom in or out, that might work.

## Time Taken to Finish this Project

> I took around **2 hours** to complete this project. The only thing that has taken much time to be implemented is how to adjust the **image as background and positing all the elements inside the page.**

I'm definitely more confident now in creating a webpage similar to this one.
